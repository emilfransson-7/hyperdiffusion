Application of hyperdiffusion
=============================

In this section we will introduce different feutures of the hyperdiffusion script. 

The only pinch we have and it can be set by choosing setting the parameter. The default value is 0.5 [m/s]. This is a very crude "model" but as we only and the pinch is independt of the density gradient it is 
sufficent for 

There are four different type of transport "models" to calculate the diffusion which the script uses. The first is just a constant diffusio, the second is a model quadraticel proportional to the
the normalized density gradient. The third is like the the second one with a constant diffusion . The fourth, and the one recommended to use, is a mimic of the IFSPPL model. This gives the effect what the 
Ion Temperature Gradient - mode (which is usually the dominant mode) has a (density) gradient. Below this value we have a very small diffsuion but above the diffusion is 
the diffusion rapidly increases with the normalized gradient.
